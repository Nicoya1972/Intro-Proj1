            <p>Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
              I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
              But when I start to tell them,
              They think I'm telling lies.
              I say,
              It's in the reach of my arms
              The span of my hips,
              The stride of my step,
              The curl of my lips.
              I'm a woman
              Phenomenally.
              Phenomenal woman,
              That's me.

            </p>
            <p>Take this kiss upon the brow!
              And, in parting from you now,
              Thus much let me avow--
              You are not wrong, who deem
              That my days have been a dream;
              Yet if hope has flown away
              In a night, or in a day,
              In a vision, or in none,
              Is it therefore the less gone?
              All that we see or seem
              Is but a dream within a dream.
              <br>
              I stand amid the roar
              Of a surf-tormented shore,
              And I hold within my hand
              Grains of the golden sand--
              How few! yet how they creep
              Through my fingers to the deep,
              While I weep--while I weep!
              O God! can I not grasp
              Them with a tighter clasp?
              O God! can I not save
              One from the pitiless wave?
              Is all that we see or seem
              But a dream within a dream?

              <em>The Road Not Taken
              </em>
            </p>
            <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
              And sorry I could not travel both
              And be one traveler, long I stood
              And looked down one as far as I could
              To where it bent in the undergrowth;
              Then took the other, as just as fair,
              And having perhaps the better claim,
              Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
              Though as for that the passing there
              Had worn them really about the same,
              And both that morning equally lay
              In leaves no step had trodden black.
              Oh, I kept the first for another day!
              Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
              I doubted if I should ever come back.
              I shall be telling this with a sigh
              Somewhere ages and ages hence:
              Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-
              I took the one less traveled by,
              And that has made all the difference.
