                I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
                But when I start to tell them,
                They think I'm telling lies.
                I say,
                It's in the reach of my arms
                The span of my hips,
                The stride of my step,
                The curl of my lips.

                And, in parting from you now,
                Thus much let me avow--
                You are not wrong, who deem
                That my days have been a dream;
                Yet if hope has flown away
                In a night, or in a day,
                In a vision, or in none,
                Is it therefore the less gone?
                All that we see or seem
                Is but a dream within a dream.
                <br>
                I stand amid the roar
                Of a surf-tormented shore,
                And I hold within my hand
                Grains of the golden sand--
                How few! yet how they creep
                Through my fingers to the deep,
                While I weep--while I weep!
                O God! can I not grasp
                Them with a tighter clasp?
                O God! can I not save
                One from the pitiless wave?
                Is all that we see or seem
                But a dream within a dream?

              <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
                And sorry I could not travel both
                And be one traveler, long I stood
                And looked down one as far as I could
                To where it bent in the undergrowth;
                Then took the other, as just as fair,
                And having perhaps the better claim,
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
                Though as for that the passing there
                Had worn them really about the same,
                And both that morning equally lay
                In leaves no step had trodden black.
                Oh, I kept the first for another day!
                Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
                I doubted if I should ever come back.
                I shall be telling this with a sigh
                Somewhere ages and ages hence:
                Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-
                I took the one less traveled by,
                And that has made all the difference.
